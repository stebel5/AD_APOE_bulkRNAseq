# AD_APOE_bulkRNAseq
Code for _APOE_ genotype-stratified differential expression and pathway analysis, and plots for bulk AD human RNA-seq datasets across 7 brain regions.

We obtained publicly available bulk RNA-Seq datasets from the Accelerating Medicines Partnership-Alzheimer’s Disease Portal (AMP-AD) under The RNAseq Harmonization Study (rnaSeqReprocessing) found at https://www.synapse.org/#!Synapse:syn9702085. The rnaSeqReprocessing study created uniformly processed RNAseq datasets from donors from three studies across 7 brain regions (Table 1.1). We downloaded all datasets on August 12, 2019. The MayoRNAseq study comprised samples from the temporal cortex and cerebellum (counts: https://www.synapse.org/#!Synapse:syn8690799; covariates: https://www.synapse.org/#!Synapse:syn3817650). The Religious Orders Study and Memory and Aging Project (ROSMAP) Study comprised samples from the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (counts: https://www.synapse.org/#!Synapse:syn8691134 ; covariates: https://www.synapse.org/#!Synapse:syn3157322). The Mount Sinai Brain Bank (MSBB) study comprised data from Brodmann areas 10 (BA 10), BA 22, BA 36, and BA 44, which are the anterior prefrontal cortex, posterior superior temporal gyrus or Wernicke’s area, perirhinal cortex, and inferior frontal gyrus or Broca’s area, respectively (counts: https://www.synapse.org/#!Synapse:syn8691099; covariates: https://www.synapse.org/#!Synapse:syn7392158). Access to the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex dataset requires a formal request to ROSMAP. To enable other researchers to explore these datasets, all code necessary for recreating the reported analyses and figures within R from our analysis are available in this repository.
